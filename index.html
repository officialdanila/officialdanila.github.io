<h2 id="header" align="center"><strong>How To Avoid Wasting Your Most Valuable Online Asset - TIME!</strong></h2>

<a id="myImg" href="http://ruseller.com" target="_blank" ><img src="images/alarm.jpg" width="307" height="450" alt="Будильник"></a>


<p>If you're involved in an internet marketing business, then
you've probably already come face-to-face with your #1
enemy - "Time Wasting".</p>

<p><em>What you need to know is that "Time Is Money". And this
applies even more to the online world, than in regular
business.</em></p>

<p>You see, anyone can become an online entrepreneur. It
doesn't involve start-up capital or expensive equipment to
start. A low grade PC and a net connection is all you need.</p>

<p>And since cash isn't really a barrier, time-management has
become all the more critical. Your challenge for success is
simply to get more done - in less time.</p>

<p>So what are the greatest online time wasters and what can
you do to avoid them?</p>

<ol start="1001">
<li>Retyping the same old thing time and time again.</li>
<li>Failing to manage your email effectively.</li>
<li>Getting sucked into pointless forum discussions.</li>
<li>Failing to set a goal, before you switch the computer on.</li>
</ol>

<ul  class="myList">
<li>Retyping the same old thing time and time again.</li>
<li>Failing to manage your email effectively.</li>
<li>Getting sucked into pointless forum discussions.</li>
<li>Failing to set a goal, before you switch the computer on.</li>
</ul>


<h4 align="center"  class="new"><b>Retyping the same old thing time and time again.</b></h4>
<p>------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>This sounds simple. But stop and think how many times you
retype the same old simple information.</p>

<p>Most people have cottoned on to automating their email
signature, but you can go far beyond that when it comes to
communicating words quickly.</p>

<p>Get yourself a clickboard or shortcut extender. This will
enable you to write much faster and prevent you from ever
having to type the same thing twice.</p>

<p>I use this utility <a href="http://www.howtocorp.com/typepilot" target="_blank" title="ДАВАЙ СЮДА">http://www.howtocorp.com/typepilot</a> , but
there are lots of other useful typing assistant utilities
available.</p>

<h4 align="center">Failing to manage your email effectively.</h4>
<p>----------------------------------------</p>

<p>I know, there's so much spam flying around, but you should
be attempting to win this war with a few weapons of your
own installed on your computer.</p>

<p>i. Make sure you have a working piece of anti-spam software
set up. Whilst sometimes the wrong messages will get
trapped, the best software will still remove 98% of the
emails that you don't want. Make sure they are filtered
into a junk email file, so you can manually sift
through them afterwards and pull back any that have
been incorrectly assumed to be unwanted.</p>

<p>ii. Set up folders in your inbox and get yourself properly
organized. I keep a folder for SALES, another one for
FEEDBACK and others for JOINT VENTURES + many more. </p>
